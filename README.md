### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jeff
#### iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI 


- Iâ€™m currently focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and my 2 main iOS projects. 
- The JANE project is to showcase basic knowledge of SwiftUI.
- My 2 main iOS projects are not public as I plan to commercialize them.
