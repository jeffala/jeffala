### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jeff
#### iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI 


- Iâ€™m currently focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and my 2 main iOS projects. 
- The JANE project is to showcase basic knowledge of SwiftUI.
- Other 2 main iOS projects are not public and will probably not be public at all or not for now.
