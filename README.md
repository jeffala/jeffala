### Hi there 👋, my name is Jeff
#### iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI 


- I’m currently focus on Data Structures and Algorithms, and my 2 main iOS projects. 
- The JANE project is to simply showcase basic knowledge of SwiftUI.
- Other 2 main iOS projects are not public and will probably not be public at all or just for now.
